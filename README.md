# Flight Record Management System

The exercise focuses on a theoretical implementation of a flight search service.

The API should allow users to search for and filter a sorted list of airline
codes (representing flights) matching their search criteria.

The service should be backed by `FlightAvailabilityService` service, which
returns all data the search service requires.

## Important points

- The intention of the exercise is to test pragmatic core java 8-11 programming
  skills, OOP and domain design.
- Focus on clean code, design patterns, and coding principles.
- Only the dependencies available in the pom should be needed and used. Lombok
  is provided to reduce boilerplate code.
- You should not create a full application (e.g. a webservice). This is just a
  service from component point of view.
- The service should be safe to be used in a concurrent environment. Additional
  non-functional requirements should also be considered.
- Please mind readability and maintainability.
- Existing files must not be changed unless explicitly asked to do so.
- Ensure that your changes can be compiled and tested running `mvn verify`. You
  should have JDK 11 and Maven 3.5.x+ installed.

## Exercise

Create a flight search service.

The API should expect a search query as an argument and return an ordered
collection of airline codes. The service should delegate whatever is possible to
the provided `FlightAvailaibilityService`
service and do additional processing of the results. Implementation
of `FlightAvailaibilityService`
is expected to be available at runtime as external dependency, so it is *not*
required to provide that implementation nor testing it.

The service should use the `FlightAvailaibilityService` to get a collection of
flights and then filter, sort and limit the results as per the followings:

- Search for flights based on origin-destination, departureDate, and number of
  travellers.
- Filter results according to whether the customer wants flights which can be
  cancelled or not, or is happy with either.
- Filter results below an average price if customer provides such maximum price.
- Sort the results by length of flight or average price depending on the
  customer's preference.
- Allow the number of results to be limited. If no limit is specified, return 3
  results.

For more information on the provided classes in
package `com.qatarairways.adapter.flight`, please refer to their javadoc
documentation.

If you happen to run into any ambiguous requirements, feel free to decide on
your own but please highlight your decision.

## Solution

1. Create a payload model 'FlightAvailabilityRequest' that contains user's basic search criteria along with advanced (filter) criteria.
2. Create 'FlightAvailabilityServiceImpl' incorporating FlightAvailabilityService interface.
3. Use CRUD methodology to fetch all the flights based on the user criteria and have all the basic filter criterias in the query model so that boiler code is reduced in service layer.
4. Use mapstruct to convert Entity data to DTO model for User's view.
5. Place filter logic (not placed in query) in the FlightAvailabilityServiceImpl and filter out exact results based on user's search criteria.

Endpoints:-

GET /seachFlight - Serves as a single endpoint to serve customer request based on his/her search choices.
